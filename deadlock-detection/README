COMMUNICATION METHOD BETWEEN OSS AND CHILD PROCESSES USED: MESSAGE QUEUES
VERBOSE IS CURRENTLY: ON

CS4760 Project 5 Bryce Paubel 4/18/23
Operating system resource management and deadlock detection simulator

Compilation:
	To compile this project, type 'make' in the project directory to use the given makefile
	
	Usage:
		./oss [-h] [-f logfile_name]
   
  Ex:
    ./oss -f log.txt OR ./oss

Note:
  I used a lot of code from old projects (as was encouraged), so header files may state that they are from project 1-4.

Version Control:
	A git logfile entitled 'proof_of_verion_control' is contained within the project directory for proof of version control.
	The .git file is also included within the project directory

Testing:
	A simple bash script was included which runs the project. It creates and deletes a log file. The main thing it does is makes sure that the outputs are consistent,
  i.e. that the statistics line up with the outputs. These outputs must be confirmed visually.

Encountered Problems:
  I actually found this project to be pretty fun. The hardest part was dealing with the finer details, which is common when working with C programs.
  The message passing actually worked pretty well for me, really no problems at all actually. The hardest part was going back and retroactively
  changing a lot of my data structures to work with new fields and such.
