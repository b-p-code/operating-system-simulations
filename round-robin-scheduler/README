CS4760 Project 4 Bryce Paubel 3/29/23
Operating system simulator scheduler

Compilation:
	To compile this project, type 'make' in the project directory to use the given makefile
	
	Usage:
		./oss [-h] [-f logfile_name]
   
  Ex:
    ./oss -f log.txt OR ./oss

Note:
  I implemented my indications for the child processes a little differently. I used negative values to indicate blocking instead of termination.
  
  There will also be header comments that will be from Project 2/3 because they have been lifted from those projects with little modification
  
  Another note - I don't have a super great reference for the time it takes to perform certain operations, so some time may seem much smaller than
  they should be and others much longer than they should be. I tried my best to make them make sense.

Version Control:
	A git logfile entitled 'proof_of_verion_control' is contained within the project directory for proof of version control.
	The .git file is also included within the project directory

Testing:
	A simple bash script was included which runs the project. It creates and deletes a log file. The main thing it does is makes sure that the outputs are consistent,
  i.e. that we scheduled and blocked processes as often as the scheduler says we did. These outputs must be confirmed visually. There is also a test program
  for the queue implementations, and instructions for running it are stored in the source file.

Encountered Problems:
  The hardest part of this project for me was actually the statistics. I was getting quite a few overflow errors since I tried using nanoseconds, but I swapped
  to (seconds, nanoseconds) and then used unsigned long longs to do calculations later, which seemed to fix my errors. I also had a hard time trying to decide
  where to keep information, since there are of course many ways to design this system.
  
  There were also quite a few little details that caused difficulties, but I was able to iron out bugs and the like.
