CS4760 Project 6 Bryce Paubel 4/29/23
Operating system memory management using paging

Compilation:
	To compile this project, type 'make' in the project directory to use the given makefile
	
	Usage:
		./oss [-h] [-f logfile_name]
   
  Ex:
    ./oss -f log.txt OR ./oss

Note:
  I used a lot of code from old projects (as was encouraged), so header files may state that they are from project 1-5.

Version Control:
	A git logfile entitled 'proof_of_verion_control' is contained within the project directory for proof of version control.
	The .git file is also included within the project directory

Testing:
	A simple bash script was included which runs the project. It creates and deletes a log file. The main thing it does is makes sure that the outputs are consistent,
  i.e. that the statistics line up with the outputs. These outputs must be confirmed visually.

Encountered Problems:
  I found this project to be pretty enjoyable. The hardest thing was actually finding
  small bugs that I encountered. For example, I had a line in my program which would
  write to the logfile if the logfile was NULL, causing a lot of resource errors
  that seemed to come from nowhere. Luckily I was able to debug the program through
  gdb to find this odd error.
  
  I also had a hard time structuring the project, and deciding where things should go.
  I decided it would be best to keep the page tables outside of the process tables,
  since that would make it easier to leave my original source code alone.
